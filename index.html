As she performed on stage and attained years of experience in winning balletic competitions, she pursued her career as a dancer and took summer school in the Royal Ballet Academy of England. Entering Sophia(Jouchi) University in Tokyo brought her a strong encounter with flamenco, and she decided to shift her career. The following year she was in Seville, Spain, taking classes from prestigious instructors like Manolo Marin, Maria del Mar Verranga, Javier Cruz, and Alicia Marquez. After her studies, she returned to Tokyo and started performing in several well known tablaos. In the year 2000, she received awards from the Japanese Flamenco Association and the Ambassador of Spain. Shortly afterwards, Mizuho started teaching in Tokyo and in her hometown, Iwate. She developed classes of flamenco history and music for further appreciation and comprehension on the Tour of Manuel Reyes Company of which she was a participant. Two years later, she returned to Spain to further develop her skills under Cristobal Reyes, la China, Manuel Linan, and studied the Spanish language. This experience led her to Los Angeles in 2004 to join Guitarist Jose Tanaka's Soniquete Flamenco and started teaching in Torrance, California. Since then, She's been performing at The Fountain Theatre in Hollywood, Alegria in Long Beach, El Cid on Sunset and many more venues. 2007 was her third time studying in Spain, including some intense classes from Familia Farruco in Seville. And in Madrid, from Marco Flores, Concha Jareno, David Paniagua, and Manuel Linan who inspire her consistantly. Briefly while returning to California, she completed her 5th successful student show in hermosa beach "iDejame Jailar!" in October 2009. During her stay in California, in March 2010, she performed at the first annual Los Angeles Flamenco Festival in the company of Briseyda Zarate and in Jose Tanaka's group as a soloist. In 2010 through 2014 working locally and outside of states, she had opportunities to work with Yaelisa Caminos Flamenco, Manuel de la Malena, Juan Ogalla, David Paniagua, and Maestro Jose Galvan. January 2015 she organized maestro Joaquin Grilo’s workshop in Hollywood and very honorably shared a stage with him on “GRILO” at the Barnsdall Theatre by her own production. On April by Manuel Gutierrez’s choreography she participated in The Floor Show at The Rey Theatre and the Puerto Vallarta tour. In July she organized Isaac de los Reyes’s workshop in LA and performed at The fountain theatre with him. Since October 2015 she relocated her business in Northern California and is planning to expand her horizon. Her choreographies are based on her balletic skill and trained body, inspired by the great maestros proceeding her, and most importantly the spirit that resides within true flamenco and not imitation. She has trained from the ground up and has the "know-how" to educate, inspire, and lead virtually any ensemble of performers into a new world of dance. </p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="22"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="24"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="25"><span data-reactid="26"><!-- react-empty: 27 --><h2 data-reactid="28"><a data-reactid="29">Mizuho Sato Flamenco</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="32"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="33"></div></section></div></div>
